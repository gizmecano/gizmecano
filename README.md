# Hello

![Mona](https://github.githubassets.com/images/mona-whisper.gif)

I make [miscellaneous things](http://mergey.ch/) using a keyboard and a mouse, mainly in the fields of web design, digital publishing and visual branding.

From time to time, I share [various technical news](https://twitter.com/gizmecano), push [a couple of bytes](https://github.com/gizmecano) or upload [variegated pixels](https://dribbble.com/gizmecano).

My current side projects include:

- [opencart-3-fr](https://github.com/gizmecano/opencart-3-fr): a French language pack for the [OpenCart](http://www.opencart.com/) ecommerce platform
- [Hereditor Theme](https://github.com/gizmecano/grav-theme-hereditor): a theme for [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) (currently in progress)
